# Centroid Discriminant Analysis (CDA) - README

## Overview

Centroid Discriminant Analysis (CDA) is an efficient and scalable (quadratic time complexity) linear classifier derived from the theoretical framework of Geometric Discriminant Analysis (GDA), and supports nonlinear classification via kernel methods. CDA realizes multiclass classification via the Error-Correcting Output Codes (ECOC) framework.

This project realises the CDA algorithm in Matlab and Python.
